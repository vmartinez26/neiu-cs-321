# Application Name: Unofficial Valorant Ranker

# Project Topic/Objective:

There is a new player in the tactical shooter genre of games and it has taken the esports world by storm. Valorant has a ranked system but it does not show which player is number one. It will be a place where players can put in-game results and place them on a ladder to see who is climbing and who is going down in the ranks. That way they can see their rank against other people in the North American region. There you can challenge your friends and see who is higher in the standings. 

# Motivation:

Well, first and foremost I was an early adopter of the game and was the one thing I spent most of my time doing during the quarantine. After having a very long history of playing videogames everyone is accustomed to seeing leaderboards. Not having a leaderboard does not give some players a reason to play once they have reached the "top". Everyone is just given the rank of Radiant but there is no clear number one.

# Server-Side Components:

The application will take in the input of the user to give them an initial rank depending on what rank was given to the player after their placements or their current rank in the season. From there we can compare it with other players and either increase or lower their ranks depending on their games won or lost.
